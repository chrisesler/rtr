&lt;rtr-router&gt; is a router built on top of Polymer
======================================================
* Routing for <b>anchor tag click events</b> and <b>form submit events</b>.
* Optional <b>lazy loading</b> of route handlers.
* <b>Static</b> and <b>parameterized</b> paths.
* Form submits are conveniently routed to their handlers with a <b>hash of input values</b>.
* <b>Everything is a custom element</b> so there is nothing new to learn.

Documentation And Demo
======================
See the [component page](http://jeffschwartz.github.io/rtr/components/rtr/) for complete <b>documentation</b> and <b>demo</b>.

Example
=======
Define your routes declaratively:

    <rtr-router>
        <demo-staticpath methdo="get"
            path="/rtr/demo-staticpath"
            handler="get"></demo-staticpath>
        <rtr-lazyroute method="get"
            path="/rtr/demo-lazystaticpath"
            importPath="/rtr/components/rtr/demo/demo-lazystaticpath.html"
            tagname="demo-lazystaticpath" handler="get"></rtr-lazyroute>
        <demo-parameterizedpath methdo="get"
            path="/rtr/demo-parameterizedpath/year/:y/month/:m/day/:d"
            handler="get"></demo-parameterizedpath>
        <rtr-lazyroute method="get"
            path="/rtr/demo-lazyparameterizedpath/year/:y/month/:m/day/:d"
            importPath="/rtr/components/rtr/demo/demo-lazyparameterizedpath.html"
            tagname="demo-lazyparameterizedpath"
            handler="get"></rtr-lazyroute>
        <demo-formsubmit method="post"
            path="/rtr/demo-formsubmit"
            handler="post"></demo-formsubmit>
        <rtr-lazyroute method="post"
            path="/rtr/demo-lazyformsubmit"
            importPath="/rtr/components/rtr/demo/demo-lazyformsubmit.html"
            tagname="demo-lazyformsubmit"
            handler="post"></rtr-lazyroute>
        <demo-redirect methdo="get"
            path="/rtr/demo-redirect"
            handler="get"></demo-redirect>
        <demo-redirecttarget methdo="get"
            path="/rtr/demo-redirecttarget"
            handler="get"></demo-redirecttarget>
    </rtr-router>
