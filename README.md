&lt;rtr-router&gt; is a router built on top of Polymer
======================================================
* Routing for <b>anchor tag click events</b> and <b>form submit events</b>.
* Optional <b>lazy loading</b> of route handlers.
* <b>Static</b> and <b>parameterized</b> paths.
* Form submits are conveniently routed to their handlers with a <b>hash of input values</b>.
* <b>Everything is a custom element</b> so there is nothing new to learn.

Documentation And Demo
======================
See the [component page](http://jeffschwartz.github.io/rtr/components/rtr/) for complete <b>documentation</b> and <b>demo</b>.

Example
=======
Define your routes using JavaScript:

    <link rel="import" href="../../polymer/polymer.html">
    <link rel="import" href="../rtr-route.html">
    <polymer-element name="demo-routes" extends="rtr-route">
        <template>
        </template>
        <script>
    ```javascript
    (function() {
        "use strict";
        Polymer("demo-routes", {
            staticPath: function(){
                document.getElementById("demo-staticpath-info").textContent =
                    "demo-staticpath \"staticPath\" route handler called";
                console.log("demo-staticpath \"staticPath\" route handler called");
            },
            parameterizedPath: function(year, month, day) {
                document.getElementById("demo-parameterizedpath-info").innerHTML =
                    "demo-parameterizedpath \"parameterizedPath\" route handler was called with parameters" +
                    "<br>year = " + year + "<br>month = " + month + "<br>day = " + day;
                console.log("demo-parameterizedpath \"parameterizedPath\" route handler called");
            },
            formSubmit: function(valuesHash) {
                document.getElementById("demo-formsubmit-info").innerHTML =
                    "demo-formsubmit \"formSubmit\" route handler was called with a form's valuesHash" +
                    "<br>name = " + valuesHash.txtName + "<br>occupation = " + valuesHash.selOccupation.toString();
                console.log("demo-formsubmit \"formSubmit\" route handler called");
            }
        });
    }());
    ```
        </script>
    </polymer-element>

Declare your routes in your markup:

    <rtr-router>
        <!-- demo-routes: declares multiple route handlers -->
        <demo-routes
            routes='[{
                "method": "get",
                "path": "/rtr/components/rtr/demo-staticpath",
                "handler": "staticPath"
            }, {
                "method": "get",
                "path": "/rtr/components/rtr/demo-parameterizedpath/year/:y/month/:m/day/:d",
                "handler": "parameterizedPath"
            }, {
                "method": "post",
                "path": "/rtr/components/rtr/demo-formsubmit",
                "handler": "formSubmit"
            }]'></demo-routes>
    </rtr-router>
