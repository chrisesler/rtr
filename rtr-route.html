/**
 * @group Router Core Elements
 *
 * 'rtr-route' element is an abstract base custom element which represent a route and must be
 * extended to be useful. It exposes base support and functionality for defining method handlers
 * that are called in response to routing requests which match its "method" (think REST verbs) and
 * "path" (think URLs) attributes. You must extend your own custom route elements from rtr-route
 * (i.e. extends="rtr-route") and provide a route handler function that will be called for the route.
 *
 *     <rtr-route
 *         method="get"
 *         path="a/url/path"
 *         handler="name_of_method_to_call"></rtr-route>
 *
 * @element rtr-route
